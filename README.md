<h2>Employee Salary Prediction using Linear Regression</h2>

🧾Summary

A machine learning project that predicts employee salaries based on demographic and job-related features using Linear Regression.

📖 Overview

✅This project focuses on analyzing employee data and building a regression model to predict salary outcomes.
✅It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, model training, evaluation, and model saving.

❓ Problem Statement

✅Organizations often struggle to estimate fair and consistent salaries based on employee attributes.

👉 Objective:
Build a machine learning model that predicts employee salary accurately using historical employee data.

📂 Dataset

File Name: <a href="https://github.com/rajan-kumar-mu1439/salary-prediction-ml/blob/main/Employees.xlsx">Employee salary dataset</a>


📌 Key Features (example):
